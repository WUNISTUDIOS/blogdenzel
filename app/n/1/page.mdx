# Biblically Accurate Slop Harvester

It is no longer a question of the ideology of work - of the traditional ethic that obscures
the "real" labour process and the "objective" process of exploitation -but of the scenario
of work. Likewise, it is no longer a question of the ideology of power, but of the scenario
of power. Ideology only corresponds to a betrayal of reality by signs; simulation
corresponds to a short-circuit of reality and to its reduplication by signs. It is always the
aim of ideological analysis to restore the objective process; it is always a false problem to
want to restore the truth beneath the simulacrum - [Baudrillard](https://web.stanford.edu/class/history34q/readings/Baudrillard/Baudrillard_Simulacra.html)
