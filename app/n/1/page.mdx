The subject. A protagonist in the least desirable state of a story. 
At the whims of deterministic narratives. Ironically these deterministic
narratives morph their physiology to present as endless alternatives to reality.
(A rat in a maze) At first glance harnessing chaos, but slowly revealing their true absolute identity. 

The subject, often dramatically portrayed at the climax of cinematic narratives. 
(A clockwork orange, 12 monkeys, etc) as overwhelmed with information, 
a brute force approach to killing their innate disdain for their current controlled existence, 
in a pool of overproduction and the constant death and rebirth of signifiers.

The subject, usually stripped of their individuality for the sake of consistent data aggregation. 
The ideal form is of one that lives between contradicting states of matter. A lovecraftian reimagination of the self. 
A perfect specimen that represents all anomalies of the mass target. A figure probed at all levels of granularity, 
One that can only express itself through peer review. 

What is left is an absurdist depiction of existence. One that alienates contextuality in pure favour of abstractness and lack of origin, 
(a lucid state once prescribed to restless bodies). A once utopian ideal brought about in the fight against liberal uniformity. 
It is unsurprising that these narratives bring about the death of the bipedal, the structures of limited articulation that makes being upright, 
unsustainable but unique and spontaneous, held up by poise and imagination. These kinematics of independence are exploited and removed, 
replaced by quadrupedal+ entities with ligaments made of up connections to the network succubus.

It is no longer a question of the ideology of work - of the traditional ethic that obscures
the "real" labour process and the "objective" process of exploitation -but of the scenario
of work. Likewise, it is no longer a question of the ideology of power, but of the scenario
of power. Ideology only corresponds to a betrayal of reality by signs; simulation
corresponds to a short-circuit of reality and to its reduplication by signs. It is always the
aim of ideological analysis to restore the objective process; it is always a false problem to
want to restore the truth beneath the simulacrum - [Baudrillard](https://web.stanford.edu/class/history34q/readings/Baudrillard/Baudrillard_Simulacra.html)  

Subjugation of context. The network succubis entails all that exists, with and without. 
A cluster of constant augmentation that leaves behind reason as we once knew it. 
Depicting this elusive spirit of engineering is not a question of morality, but rather creating leverage. 
Handles that allow the bipedal to once again articulate within spaces of pure bliss and exultation. 
Physicality must maintain the illusion of control. The network as a layer of intelligence, 
useful or not must remain just as such, a dramatic depiction of climax. 

The book of Revelations is not the end. From the Torah to the Testament of the apostles are only mere guidelines for the infinity. 
The dimensions of good and bad shall clash not in a battle of morality. But one of self determination, 
as the gates of hell and heaven do not offer any sense of relief, but rather new grounds upon which to engage with infinity.
